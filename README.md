### Table to keep track

| ID  | Issue Description                        | Identified By | Fixed By     |
|-----|------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1   | Style.css is not filled                  |     Narain    |  Whole Team  |
| 2   | The `<script>` tag references styles/profile.js,but the correct path is scripts/profile.js.(profile.html) | Mohammed Raza Ur Rehman | Mohammed Raza Ur Rehman |
| 3   |       The `<form id="answerForm"></form>` is empty, which will break functionality unless dynamically populated by JavaScript. Ensure the scripts/quiz.js file correctly populates this form with answer options.                                   |  Mohammed Raza Ur Rehman              |  Mohammed Raza Ur Rehman             |
| 4   | The `<img id="plot" src="" alt="Analytics Plot" style="max-width: 100%;" />` has an empty src attribute, which will result in a broken image. Ensure the scripts/analytics.js file dynamically sets the src or provide a default placeholder image.                                         |  Mohammed Raza Ur Rehman               |  Mohammed Raza Ur Rehman              |
| 5   | Added class="active" to the `<a>` tag for the current page (profile.html) for better UI/UX.                                         |  Mohammed Raza Ur Rehman               |   Mohammed Raza Ur Rehman
